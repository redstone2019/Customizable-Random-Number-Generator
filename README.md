## Installing
In order to run it download by clicking [releases](https://github.com/redstone2019/Customizable-Random-Number-Generator/releases/latest). Take note of where it downloads to.
## Using The Tool
If you just run the exe it will default to 100 Random Numbers, a Minimum Value of 1, a Maximum Value of 100, and a Wait Time of 100ms.
### Windows OS
| To use different variables open a cmd.exe window |
|--------------------------------------------------|

Go to the directory of the file `cd C:\"Where you downloaded the program to"`

Run `rng-win.exe`
### Using Flags
To use flags (change amount of random numbers, etc.) first follow the steps for your OS.
Next read the example below. You can use as many or as few flags as you want but all the options are below.

`rng-win.exe -ncount="Anything 1 or Higher" -nmin="Anything 1 or Higher" -nmax="Anything Higher than nmin" -nwait="Anything 0 or Higher"`
### Finding the Log
When the program completes it will have written your random numbers to a logfile. The logfile will be in the same folder as the program, and will end with ".log".
